# Basic teamwork workflow

git checkout master

git pull

git checkout -b mybranch   # copy from master branch and create a new branch "mybranch"

# --- switch to mybranch, work on mybranch

git add .

git commit -m "change messages"

git push --set-upstrem origin mybranch   # keep local mybranch and remote mybranch the same

# --- on GitHub, create pull request to merge mybranch into master

# --- for merge conflict (no matter what reasons cause), two ways to resolve it:

1. git push -f origin master

2. git pull origin master, then locally edit and resolve the conflict, then git add ., git commit -m " ", 
then git push origin master

# --- rebase tips
after rebase, must do git push -f origin master, to keep local and remote master sync!

# --- for the new features added by other team members, pull and get the latest contents
git pull origin master
