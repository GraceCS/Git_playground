# Basic teamwork workflow

!!! Always create a new branch for a new feature about to add, 
and remember one PR corresponds to one branch, all commits belonging to this branch will go to the same PR

git checkout master

git pull

git checkout -b mybranch   # copy from master branch and create a new branch "mybranch"

# --- switch to mybranch, work on mybranch

git add .

git commit -m "change messages"

git push --set-upstrem origin mybranch   # keep local mybranch and remote mybranch the same

# --- on GitHub, create pull request to merge mybranch into master
# after merge pull request, in local terminal:
git pull origin master    # to make local master up to date

# --- for merge conflict (no matter what reasons cause), two ways to resolve it:

1. git push -f origin master

2. git pull origin master, then locally edit and resolve the conflict, then git add ., git commit -m " ", 
then git push origin master

# --- rebase tips
after rebase, must do git push -f origin master, to keep local and remote master sync!

# --- for the new features added by other team members, pull and get the latest contents
git pull origin master
