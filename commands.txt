git push -u origin master   # remember push to origin master next time, directly use git push

git pull origin master

# when local branch conflicts to remote one, used forced update
git push -f origin master

# squash commits to one final condensed commit
# to make git log concise and neat
# NOTICE! before rebase, you know make sure already did git push to make local and remote repo identical

git rebase -i commit_num  # squash commits from head till including this number

# link local repo to remote repo
git remote add origin remote_http_url
